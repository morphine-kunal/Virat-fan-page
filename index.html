      <h1>Early Life</h1>
      <hr />
      <br />
      <p>
        Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in New Delhi into a Punjabi
        Hindu family.His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his
        mother, Saroj Kohli, is a homemaker. He has an older brother, Vikash,
        and an older sister, Bhavna.
      </p>
      <div class="container">
        <img src="img/virat-kohli-2.jpg" alt="early age pic" id="child" />

        <p>
          &nbsp;Kohli was raised in Uttam Nagar and started his schooling at
          Vishal Bharti Public School.In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy
          was created and a nine-year-old Kohli was part of its first
          intake.Kohli trained at the academy under coach Rajkumar Sharma and
          also played matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy at Vasundhara Enclave
          at the same time.In ninth grade, he shifted to Saviour Convent in
          Paschim Vihar to advance his cricket practice. His family lived in
          Meera Bagh until 2015 when they moved to Gurgaon.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Kohli's father died on 18 December 2006 due to a stroke after being
        bed-ridden for a month.According to Kohli, his father supported his
        cricket training during his childhood, "My father was my biggest
        support. He was the one who drove me to practice everyday. I miss his
        presence sometimes." His mother noted that:
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp; &emsp; Virat changed a bit after that day. Overnight he became a
        much more matured person. He took every match seriously. He hated being
        on the bench. It's as if his life hinged totally on cricket after that
        day. Now, he looked like he was chasing his father's dream which was his
        own too.
